        <p>We will review your designs (website or mobile/web app) and explore where the design works well and where it
            can be improved. We focus our process around one central question: “What can we do to make this design more
            efficient?”</p>

            <p>We provide several strategies for further redesign by various contractors, from freelancers to high-end
                agencies. We provide you with an assessment of the timing and cost for both a full redesign and quick
                but effective improvements.</p>
